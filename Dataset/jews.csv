0,2021-01-01 14:01:02,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein met this afternoon, at the anti-coronavirus vaccination facility in Umm Al-Fahm, the 1,000,000th person in Israel to be vaccinated. Also participating in the visit were Umm Al-Fahm Mayor Samir Sobhi Mahameed, Clalit Healthcare Services Chairman Harel Locker, Maccabi Healthcare Services Chairman Ran Saar, the official responsible for coronavirus affairs in the Arab sector, Ayman Saif; Jabarin Muhammad (66), a resident of Umm Al-Fahm, was the 1,000,000th person in Israel to be vaccinated. Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""What excitement, Jabarin is the 1,000,000th person in the State of Israel to be vaccinated. We are breaking all of the records. We brought millions of vaccines to the State of Israel. We are ahead of the entire world and now we are ahead of them with our excellent HMOs. We are moving forward at great speed in order to vaccinate the entire population. It is important to me also that the Arab population in the State of Israel be vaccinated quickly. It is important because this saves lives and only thus will we be able to return to normal lives. As soon as we reach a critical mass of people who are vaccinated, we will be able to open commerce, the stores and the restaurants. We will be able to fly abroad, to make deals and travel in all the countries that we have made peace with, peace that has opened the world and is also changing our history, as Israeli society and as a country. There is responsibility and there is a lack of responsibility. The responsibility is to bring the vaccines and distribute them. The lack of responsibility is ‚Äì at the same time ‚Äì to allow the disease to run amok. I regret that this has not happened; therefore, I would like to take this opportunity here and say that we will continue to bring vaccines and I call on the public to be vaccinated."" Health Minister Edelstein: ""Now, after the 1,000,000th person to be vaccinated is here with us, it is possible to say with certainty that Israel, with G-d's help, will be the first country in the world to be vaccinated. This is a great achievement. Within a few months, we will be able to say: 'Hasta la vista' to the coronavirus and return to normality. We are all in this together. There is no difference between Jews and Arabs, religious and secular. As long as we are unsuccessful in reaching great numbers of vaccinated people in every place, we will be unable to go out to all of the places that are so important to us all. But we are not there yet and we must strictly adhere to the directives. It is a pity for each person who, instead of being at home, is in serious condition in a coronavirus ward in hospital. Come and let us make another effort to emerge from this with minimal patients and victims and without the virus running amok again.""

19,2021-01-24 19:18:24,"Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs remarks at the start of the Cabinet meeting: ""Today we are closing Ben-Gurion International Airport. Contrary to what is being said, we are ahead of the whole world. No country has done what we are about to do. We are doing this. We are hermetically closing the skies apart from very rare exceptions in order to prevent the entry of mutated viruses and in order to ensure that we will advance quickly with our vaccines operation, 'Back to Life', so that we will vaccinate more Israelis within a short time. I would like to emphasize that just this week, in which we are approving closing the skies, we will vaccinate another approximately one million Israelis. We are thereby ensuring that the damage from the mutation, if it enters, and from additional variants, if they enter, will be much smaller, and of course, we will be able to open our economy. Until now we have vaccinated approximately 2.5 million Israeli citizens with the first dose of the vaccine. Of these, around one million citizens have received the second dose. I would like to appeal to people over 60 who have yet to be vaccinated; this is about 20% of you. 80% is a very fine result but it is not enough because 20% of you are susceptible to being hurt. I urge you ‚Äì go and be vaccinated. Our goal is to increase the pace of vaccinations within a few days, perhaps tomorrow or the day after, to 250,000 vaccinations per day. This is a vast number. In the US, up until today, approximately four million people have been vaccinated with two doses. We have 1/40 the population and have already vaccinated one million people with two doses. That means we are vaccinating at 10 times the pace as the US. In this way, we are guarding the outer envelope and massively vaccinating from within. Later this week we will hold a discussion on the strategy for exiting the lockdown. I assure you that we will do this cautiously and responsibly. I would like to say something about following the directives. I expect all citizens of Israel to follow the directives, and this includes all sectors, including the ultra-orthodox sector. I must point out that the majority in the ultra-orthodox sector are following the directives, but there are exceptions and exceptions whose actions are unacceptable. Therefore, whoever does not follow the directives, we will act and we will enforce the law. We will also enforce the directives, of course, as needs to be done, everywhere. I would also like to say that I am advancing legislation, which we will submit to the Knesset tomorrow, regarding the fines. This is what must be done. We are submitting it for a first reading because this is what the law says must be done when the Knesset is in recess but the intention is to pass it on its second and third readings without delay. This is also my directive; I hope that you will also cooperate. Today we are also submitting the historic agreement on the establishment of relations between Israel and Morocco. Indeed this is a historic moment, after four peace agreements with four Islamic and Arab countries in four months. I would like to commend King Mohammed VI of Morocco on the cooperation between us. Together we are advancing direct flights between the countries, which will happen soon, as well as economic, commercial and technological cooperation and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì the opening of missions in the two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to again congratulate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their entry into office. I look forward to working with President Biden to further strengthen the strong alliance between the US and Israel, expand the circle of peace between Israel and the Arab world on behalf of a new Middle East and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì to also deal with our common challenges, especially the Iranian threat."" The Prime Minister added: ""This week we will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The victims of the Holocaust, six million of our people; this is a number that we have already surpassed in the State of Israel. Nevertheless, there are those who aspire to destroy the State of Israel and say so openly, on a daily basis, and this is the regime of the ayatollahs in Iran. They speak not about the annihilation of another six million, we are already approaching seven million Jews, they intend to try and destroy us ‚Äì inter alia ‚Äì by developing nuclear weapons. They are furthering the new antisemitism with a wave that opposes what we are doing with some of the Arab countries, who have already changed their attitude to the Jewish people, to Jews in general, and also to the State of Israel. They are stoking venomous antisemitism any way they can in order to destroy us and kill additional millions. Of course, their strange allies, that they have in Europe, who are sometimes anti-Muslim as well, are also in on this. They share this anti-Jewish, antisemitic line.

28,2021-01-27 6:01:08,"Today, January 27th, the world officially commemorates the six million Jewish men, women and children brutally murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators in the Holocaust. We remember this darkest chapter in human history, when a European country decided to adopt a policy and a program to exterminate every last Jew, mobilizing the full power of a modern developed industrial state to implement this incredible nightmare. The mass murder of the Jewish people did not happen in a vacuum. For centuries antisemitism had been all too prevalent across Europe. Unchallenged, it grew and festered and then exploded. This oldest of hatreds had unquestionable longevity. Its roots stretch back to the ancient world. It was ever-present throughout the middle ages. And yet, it exploded with full force in the modern era. And if people thought that following the horrors of Auschwitz and Treblinka, humanity would finally learn its lesson and rid itself of antisemitism, that it would throw it into the dustbin of history where it belongs, well, they were wrong. Dead wrong. In the twenty-first century, the disease of antisemitism continues to contaminate and spread. It can be found alive, kicking and pernicious on North American university campuses, in South Asian madrassas, among European elites. Antisemitism exists in the affluent West and in the developing world in the East. It is the official policy of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which unabashedly and proudly says day in and day out: our goal is to murder another six million Jews, to eradicate the Jewish State of Israel. A vaccine to safeguard against the antisemitism virus has yet to be found. It is said that some things never change. But I can tell you what has changed. We the Jewish people have changed. If at the time of the Holocaust, the Jews were homeless, stateless, defenseless, begging others to protect us ‚Äì no longer. Today we are firmly rooted in our ancient land, free and strong in our independent state. As prime minister of the country that was reborn after the Holocaust, the country that provided a homeland for the survivors, a state that rose from the ashes, a state in which the Jewish people regained their sovereignty and independence, I vow never to forget the tragic past and never to allow the Jewish people to once again be defenseless against the forces that seek our destruction. Never again isn‚Äôt a slogan. This is our policy and this is our mission and we will always carry it out.

We have brought vaccines for every citizen of the State of Israel, everyone without exception, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Bedouin, Circassians, Druze, Christians ‚Äì everyone without exception. We are in a situation in which we can exit from this accursed disease and gradually open our economy. We must make a common effort to exit from the coronavirus thanks to the millions of vaccines that we have. We can open our economy if we take care to fight the mutation. The mutation is currently striking the whole world; we are in a close race with it. We want to win and get rid of it; for this, a final effort is required. I know how difficult this is for citizens, the self-employed and businesses. I understand this. We all understand this. Nevertheless, this effort is required because only we will be able to end the pandemic.

In the US, it will be necessary to lock down the country for six months to a year. We need to close for a few weeks. We can end and vaccinate everybody and we are being released. This is a great thing. To this end, an effort is needed, an addition to the lockdown, which I know, is difficult, closing the borders as well. With G-d's help, and with yours, come and be vaccinated.

39,2021-02-02 18:28:23,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein issued statements on the issue of the coronavirus. Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""We are in the midst of a race between the 'Back to Life' vaccines operation and the mutation. This vaccines operation is our key to the coronavirus exit plan. When I say that a mutation is striking us, it is striking the entire world. In Germany they are currently talking about extending the state of emergency until June and in other countries they are extending the tightened lockdowns for many weeks. Three times as many people have died in Britain as in Israel. Every one, of course, is a loss. The mutation is also striking us. I would like to show you to what extent it is spreading. [A slide is shown.] Several days ago, it was responsible for 70% of our samples. It seems that it currently stands at 80%, a powerful and rapid spread. This is what is challenging our health system. 97% of those who have died are in the 50-and-over age group. Almost 100% of the deceased are there. Regarding serious cases, 93% of serious cases are in the 50-and-over age group. This is striking us and doing so very clearly. If we take control of the disease in these ages, if we succeed in vaccinating and protecting the people in this group, to a large extent we will be on the way to victory over the coronavirus, of course, if there are no surprises such as new mutations that we are not familiar with and which could enter Israel. This is why we closed the borders as you know. Today, I am proposing a national goal as the basis for our exit from the coronavirus: To vaccinate at least 90% of the 50+ age group within two weeks. This is an achievable goal because 77% of them are already vaccinated. We hope to complete this within the next two weeks. I call on whoever is watching us this evening, if you have not yet been vaccinated, go and be vaccinated. It is important not only for you, it is important for all of us because it is what will enable us to gradually open the economy and it is what will enable us, mainly, to save lives. I would like to tell you, every day is decisive. The significance of another three days of lockdown is another approximately 200,000 protected people. That is to say, people who received the second vaccine plus one week. Among these are 120,000 people over 50. This is simply the saving of lives. Vaccinating the 50+ age group will enable us to gradually exit from the lockdown, to save many lives and open the economy. I know that we do not intend to do this waiting for the opening. We will start the gradual opening already next week but we will exit cautiously. I will submit this national goal to the Cabinet and we will submit it together with our exit plan. I reiterate: We will exit cautiously for the exact reason you have seen here and what is happening around the world. We are one people. We will overcome this. I call on everyone: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, religious, secular, everybody: Go and be vaccinated. We are not delaying the vaccines of all the rest. This is being done according to the Health Ministry preferences. But first of all I call on everyone over 50: Go and be vaccinated immediately.""",0.11600884,0.005647734,0.033721898,0.061592385,0.018418092,0.014618298

108,2021-04-03 23:19:47,"MY TURN GUYANA By Moses V. Nagamootoo RESURRECTION OF RESISTANCE As we celebrate Easter, we must remind ourselves that Christ‚Äôs holy mission is not complete. While the poor remain ‚Äòblessed‚Äô, they are yet to inherit the Earth. Far from it: they are the 99% of Earth‚Äôs estimated 7.7 billion people who own only one percent of the wealth of the world. The filthy rich have gobbled up almost everything. Surely goodness and mercy have eluded the poor, the so-called ‚Äúwretched of the earth‚Äù, who are today most vulnerable to the deadliest virus of all times. SYSTEMIC RACISM They are the ones who endure poverty, hunger and disease. They are the victims of wars waged by foreigners and their proxies. They are made destitute by their home-grown tyrants and corrupt cabals. They are exploitation by Big Business; and suffer systemic racism and injustices. So, Easter must represent the resurrection of resistance to the evils that engulf us. Growing up in a rural village, I saw squalor around me. Many children roam the village in rags, without shoes, uncertain about the future. My parents were not exactly poor, so I also saw how they reached out to those who could not make ends meet. As a boy I would sometimes look at the clouds. I would imagine on them the image of a gentle God who could change the life of my villagers for the better. VICIOUS CYCLE At about eleven years, I voluntarily baptized at the Lutheran Church, as I searched for salvation for the many who were trapped in the vicious cycle of want and hopelessness. But I realized soon enough how several foreign preachers mis-used the scriptures for political purposes. Instead of helping the poor to free themselves from their colonial shackles, they preached anti-communism; vilified righteous leaders; and peddled from way back then, outrageous lies packaged as ‚Äúplain truth‚Äù. Six decades later we continued to see how the lofty mission I had imagined has been hijacked by so-called extremists to bludgeon civilized and democratic norms, to spread racist fears and terror, and to unleash hate and discrimination. The targeting of Blacks is not a peculiar American phenomenon. Since the advent of capitalism, they have been hunted commercially for their black skin, as Karl Marx had observed. In the United States, we have seen the targeting of Black Americans, most of whom are themselves Christians. Now, we are witnessing gruesome attacks against Asian Americans, mostly those of Chinese origins. In the late 1960s, while on a bus in London, I was attacked by a gang of ‚ÄúSkinheads‚Äù ‚Äì white youths with shaved heads. They were in shabby clothes, but they wore racism in their heart. They were on a frenzy of ‚ÄúPaki-bashing‚Äù and, as a Guyanese of Asian background, they must have concluded that I was a Paki. Lucky for me, a group of Jamaicans came to my rescue. I am aware that there are many Indo-Guyanese in the United States who wrongly feel that the ‚Äòpogrom‚Äô of anti-Asian hate excludes them. It‚Äôs the Blacks; it‚Äôs the Latinos; it‚Äôs the Chinese. But, as Pastor Martin Niemoller advised during Nazi reign: ‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.‚Äù TIME FOR SOLIDARITY Today we must stand up to the wrongs being done around us. We must resist anti-Chinese xenophobia. We can no longer remain silent. This is the time for solidarity with all victims of hate and violence. I remember only too well the American war of aggression against Vietnam. It was wrongly felt that the mighty empire would crush those ‚Äútiny yellow people‚Äù, as Muhamad Ali once described the heroic Vietnamese people. America learned a humiliating lesson not only because the Vietnamese people stood up against bullyism, but because the world stood in solidarity with them and their just cause. The American thinker Herbert Aptheker reminded us that resistance is the core of history. We must not lose hope. We too must resist the abuse of race and religion by evil-doers everywhere.

This ceremony gives clear expression to this because the desire to commemorate is underscored in our people, which lost millions of our brothers and sisters in the Holocaust. We saw this desire yesterday at the torchlighting ceremony that always moves us every year. Manya Bigunov, one of the torchlighters, has dedicated her life, all of time and energy to commemorating each of the 2,000 Jews who perished from her town of Teplyk. My father-in-law Shmuel Ben-Artzi, my wife Sara's father, evaded the Holocaust because he was a pioneer. He came here in 1933. He was a Tanakh scholar; Ben-Gurion invited him to his first Tanakh study circle. He was a poet and a talented author, who won Ka-Tzenik Prize for Holocaust Literature and taught generations of students, some of whom are known to you and who said that he was an educator and teacher par excellance. While he built a life, married Chava his wife and brought four children into the world, the Holocaust never left him for a moment. We spoke with him. We said 'Come, go back to and revisit the places of your youth, Bilgoraj, and while he did not want to go back, he did want to recreate. He did so in his marvelous, moving poems, one of which I always read here. He also recreated in the book that he wrote in the last years of his life, he passed away at 97. He wrote a marvelous book entitled 'Novardok', an exemplary book about the musar yeshiva where he studied in Mezeritch. In it he describes Mezeritch which had been 80% Jewish, a college town of yeshivas, most of them Chasidic. It had yeshivas, study halls and synagogues. He dedicated his book to his old classmates, the yeshiva students who all perished. In the book, he describes 'Butchers' Street and 'Shoemakers' Street in detail. But he never went back. After his passing, his daughter, my wife Sara; his grandsons Yair and Avner, traveled together to visit the places of his youth. They went to Mezeritch. What remains are the street names, 'Butchers' and 'Shoemakers'. There reached the place where the yeshiva had been. An elderly Pole who knew who they were saw them and brought them a photograph and said 'Here is a photograph of my father who stood here'. In the photograph, they saw the yeshiva, no trace of which remains. From there they went to Tarnogrod, which had been the family's city, the family of Shmuel's grandfather who would go there every summer. Tarnogrod also had been a mainly Jewish city. Nothing remains. No trace remains of the synagogue that the SS and the Gestapo used as a stable. One can see where the holy ark was and can see bullet marks; they used to enjoy shooting at it. From Tarnogrod, they went to the grove by the river where there is a monument to the Jews of Tarnogrod who were slaughtered. Another elderly Pole came by and said 'I was a child and I would see every day how the Nazis brought Jews here and slaughtered them', including Shmuel's family of course. When they reached Bilgoraj, there was nothing because the town was totally destroyed in the war, the city of his birth, also where Isaac Bashevis Singer grew up, and Shmuel himself whom you know. A world was destroyed but exists in books, in this ceremony, in memories in the hearts of our people. Shmuel sought to commemorate it another way. In his will, he commanded that the names, which I will read to you now, be etched on his grave, which they are. Here are the names: From Bilgoraj in Poland, which was entirely destroyed in the Holocaust: His father (my wife's grandfather) Moshe Hahn (Ben Zeev Hahn), his father's wife Ita Hahn, his (my father-in-law's) twin sister Yehudit, who was 24. Shmuel did not stop weeping for her until the day before he died. His brothers Meir Dov Hahn (18), Shimon Tzvi (16) and Aryeh Leib (13), and his little sister Feizele (10). From Tarnogrod: His aunt (his father's sister) Ma'tel Koenigstein, her son Hillel and her eldest daughter. His uncle Mendel Hahn, his wife and their two children. Also from Bilgoraj: His uncle Avraham Tauber, his wife and their son and daughter. His aunt Rachel Tauber .and her three sons ‚Äì Avraham, Yaakov and Shlomo, and their wives and children. His aunt Hinda and her husband Yehezkel. His aunt Hendel, her husband and their children. His aunt Paula and her two daughters. May the memories of our brothers and sisters who perished in the Holocaust be etched in our hearts and in our souls forever.""

Our reputation in the world was completely justified because it genuinely expressed this true relationship, which is rooted deep in the heart of the citizens of Israel. But on the other hand, one cannot deny that over the years there has been a certain slackening as happens in every bureaucratic establishment and it has become necessary to reinvigorate our commitment in both reforms and budgets. Today we are submitting for Cabinet approval the reform of the Defense Ministry Rehabilitation Division, a step that is both necessary and the right thing to do. Following many discussions and great efforts on our part, and personal intervention by myself and the Defense Minister, we have reached agreements that will get the reform underway. As we promised, this year we will transfer approximately NIS 300 million to the Rehabilitation Division, a budget that will be entered into the base of the state budget.

192,2021-05-15 21:31:19,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: It has been five days since Hamas brazenly fired rockets at Jerusalem and other Israeli cities in a totally unprovoked attack. This past week, millions of Israelis were forced into bomb shelters as missiles rained down on our cities. Several Israelis have been killed. Many more have been wounded. You know and I know, no country would tolerate this. Israel will not tolerate this. Israel has responded forcefully to these attacks and we will continue to respond forcefully until the security of our people is reinstated and restored. We‚Äôve eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists and taken out hundreds of terrorist sites, including missile launchers and buildings that Hamas used to plan and perpetrate these attacks. Two nights ago, Israel also seriously degraded the terror infrastructure of Hamas. We knocked out part of the vast subterranean tunnel network that Hamas uses to attack Israel. I want to remind the world that in firing on our cities, Hamas is committing a double war crime. They‚Äôre targeting our civilians and hiding behind Palestinian civilians, effectively using them as human shields. As always, Israel is doing everything possible to protect our civilians and keep Palestinian civilians out of harm‚Äôs way. We demonstrated this yet again today when we warned civilians to vacate the building used by the Hamas terror intelligence. They vacated the premises before the target was destroyed and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt hear of casualties from these collapsing terror towers because we take special care to avoid these civilian casualties, exactly the opposite of Hamas. Defeating Hamas does not only serve Israel's interest, it serves the interests of all those who seek peace, stability and security in the Middle East. I want to thank Israel‚Äôs many friends in the international community who have strongly backed Israel‚Äôs action in defending ourselves. I want to thank the President of the United States Joe Biden and I want to thank the many countries, including European countries, who flew the Israeli flag in solidarity on their government buildings. No one should have any equivocation about the choice that is so clear here and I want to thank President Biden for his clear and unequivocal support. You cannot equate a democracy that values life with a terror organization that glorifies death. I also want to say a word about the violence we have seen in recent days within Israeli towns, from Lod to Bat Yam, from Akko to Haifa. The Jewish state will not tolerate pogroms against our citizens. We will not allow our Jewish citizens to be lynched or to live in fear of murderous Arab gangs. We will not tolerate the torching of synagogues and the torching of property. At the same time, we will not allow Jews to take the law into their own hands and attack innocent Arabs, or lynch an innocent Arab; there was one such case, such effort. We will not allow these attacks on innocent Jews or Arabs alike. To tolerate this unacceptable vigilantism and violence is to pave a way to anarchy. Israel is the Jewish and democratic state, where all our citizens, Jews, Arabs and everyone else, are equal before the law and will receive equal protection from those who enforce the law. I am fully confident that Israel will be able to deal with these threats from without and these threats from within. I am confident in our army. I am confident in our police. And above all, I am confident in the resolve and determination of the people of Israel. Just as we‚Äôve always done, we will weather this storm and emerge stronger than ever. Thank you.

199,2021-05-16 16:18:48,"Statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this afternoon, with the Defense Minister and the IDF Chief-of-Staff, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv: ""Citizens of Israel, our campaign against the terrorist organizations is continuing with full force. We are exacting very heavy prices from Hamas for its intolerable aggression. The IDF has carried out attacks on over 1,500 targets in recent days. We have struck very hard at Hamas's underground activity. Hamas invested an entire decade and vast capital in the excavation of tunnels; most of it, not all, but a considerable part, is gone. Hamas's 'metro' has been transformed from a strategic asset into a deathtrap for terrorists. I said it yesterday and I will say it again today: No terrorist is immune. Additionally, we struck at Hamas's UAVs and drones, as well as at their naval capability. We have destroyed stockpiles of missiles and rockets. We have wrecked terrorist buildings, command centers and infrastructures throughout the Gaza Strip. We are doing this while making an effort to minimize injury to uninvolved persons. I salute the IDF, the ISA, the soldiers and fighters ‚Äì they are all doing excellent work and we are very proud of them. I request that you, Defense Minister and IDF Chief-of-Staff, convey my congratulations, our congratulations, the congratulations of the entire nation, to the soldiers of the IDF and to the fighters of the ISA as well, and to the other men and women of the security services who are doing extraordinary work. With stratagems we make war [see Proverbs 24:6] and with daring we will be victorious. We are continuing to take action, even at this hour, as long as necessary to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel. It will yet take time. There is talk about international pressure. There is always pressure but all in all we are receiving very serious backing, first of all from the US. Again, I would like to thank our friend, President Joe Biden, and also the many other countries that have truly taken incredible steps such as flying the Israeli flag over their government buildings. We very much appreciate this. There is a reason for this support because after the reprehensible attacks, such as those in Jerusalem, against Israel's cities, in the attempt to kill innocent Israeli citizens ‚Äì we have international backing and we are using it, in our natural right to self-defense as well. This is what we did in Gaza and this is also what we are doing inside the country. I welcome the trend of calm that we see among the Arab public; it is not absolute. We just had a ramming attack in Jerusalem. However, all in all, we have seen a decline in this trend of violence by the Arab public and this is very important among the Arab public. I have always said that it is not the entire public and not a majority of the public but it is a significant minority, which we must deal with. We want to exact a price from the aggressor as in all types of terrorism. To restore the quiet and security and to rebuild deterrence and governance, will take time. In the face of these violent events, we have used the ISA. We deployed reinforced units throughout the country and we have carried out hundreds of arrests. We are taking action against those who used violence and disturbed the peace ‚Äì they will be punished. Our goal is, first, to halt the violence. I hope that we are achieving this. Afterwards, to rehabilitate the relations between Jews and Arabs. We live together in this state and we need to get back on the track of coexistence, cooperation and partnership in the great success called 'the State of Israel'. I would like to say an additional word, to you, citizens of Israel. What Hamas wants to achieve is, first of all, as many dead Israelis as possible. The achievement that I would like to achieve, that we would all like to achieve, is, first of all, to save your lives. Therefore, I would like to remind you that for an entire year, we changed our behavior because of the coronavirus; we changed our routine. Thanks to our behavior, thanks to the actions we took together, we saved many lives. Therefore, I ask you all ‚Äì minimize outdoor activity. Follow the directives. I am proud of your endurance. This evening we will celebrate Shavuot (https://www.jewfaq.org/holidayc.htm), the festival of the giving of the Torah. When the Torah was given, when we received the Ten Commandments, the people of Israel stood together, as Rashi (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rabbi-shlomo-yitzchaki-rashi) writes, 'As one person, with one heart.'
