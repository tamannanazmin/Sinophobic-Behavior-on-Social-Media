2021-01-23 22:36:07,"MY TURN GUYANA PULL BACK; MOVE FORWARD! By Moses Nagamootoo With just under six months in office, the new government seemed to be retreating into a poisonous bubble, into a cocoon of malice, pettiness and spite. It should pull back, and move forward! At the risk of focusing again on American politics, I just want to point out that when asked about his position on speeding up the impeachment hearing for the former president, President Biden politely bounced the question off. Firmly planting his administration‚Äôs priorities, he responded that he needs as much time as possible to address national emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic (that has already claimed 414,000 American lives) by getting a million vaccines daily into arms, and to secure bipartisan support for his nearly two-trillion-dollar relief and stimulus programme. LEARN AND LEAD Reading between the lines, I suspect that for President Biden the hearing into the articles of impeachment ought to take a back seat, for now; even as it appears daunting to secure 17 votes from Republicans in the Senate for the required two-thirds majority to convict Trump. In my last column I wrote that we should ‚Äúlook and learn‚Äù. Now I believe that we should learn and lead. On the foreign policy front, now that the Trump outfit has been dislodged from the White House saddle, Guyana does not have to follow the reactionary wolf-pack that traded rigged elections for mindless and subservient tutelage. With Pompeo put in his ignoble place and slapped with sanctions by China, Guyana should not feel bullied to make sellout concessions to his once honeyed-tongue diplomats, his party‚Äôs investor-donor class, their lobbyists and so-called advisors. POLITICAL WITCH-HUNTING At home, we should pull back from the frenzied and debilitating campaign of political witch-hunt, or tit-for-tats. Instead, the administration should explore every opportunity that could help our nation to heal, and to move forward with some semblance of unity. I watched a re-play of an interview with President Biden, when he was asked by Chinese President Xi Jinping to describe America. In one word, he answered, ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù. This administration ought to know that there is after every fresh elections a very narrow window of opportunities to deliver manifesto promises. Sooner, like a meandering cyclone, would come disaffection and resentment that would uproot the crop of goodwill. Unfortunately, there are underlings who are instead lost in a delusional interlude that the prosecution of petty politics would take us to the higher plane of opportunities about which Biden spoke, to reunite and build our country. In the past we fussed about things such as stolen law books. Now, we are busy burrowing into a proverbial gold mine for wrist bands and chains, apparently looking for the Lost City of El Dorado. BLOODY KNIFE In past days I looked on in utter disbelief and shame at how these self-righteous hunters of the Lost Ark of Noah tried to dig up the noble remains of former Ambassador and exemplary patriot, Dr. Odeen Ishmael, to recoup literally a handful of coins that ought to have been written off several years ago due to bureaucratic bungling under a previous PPP government. The would-be assassins of Ishmael‚Äôs integrity still wield the bloody knife that had been plunged into the body of others who were not allowed to defend themselves in what has become a wholesale purge of some 1,000 persons from government jobs. Upon his death on January 5, 2019, I recalled how over 50 years ago, Odeen and I ‚Äúsurvived the Stalinist purge only to become victims of it after‚Äù. Now, like the satraps about whom Pablo Neruda spoke after the coup in Chile, I again see this ghoulish craving for revenge by a gang that is impervious to hurting the feelings of others and their loved ones. But I would not include in that pack the ‚Äúold guards‚Äù, once the ‚Äúcomrades‚Äù of the late Ambassador, who served selflessly as our country‚Äôs top envoy for 21 years. They too need to take a stand against vendetta politics, if only to show that they have not lost both their say and significance.

2021-01-29 1:42:33,"üí∞üî¥Biden Bombshellüí∞üî¥ Hunter Biden, the youngest son of President Joe Biden, appears to have kept his ten percent stake in an international private equity firm with ties to the Chinese government, despite promising to sell his share in the venture. Biden, a one-time lobbyist who reinvented himself as an international businessman during his father‚Äôs tenure in the Obama administration, officially resigned from the board of Bohai Harvest RST (BHR) in October 2019. At the time, the younger Biden cited his father‚Äôs then-budding presidential campaign as the reason for his departure, suggesting he did not want to give the appearance of a conflict of interest. As part of his decision to resign, Hunter Biden‚Äôs family associates suggested he would unload his stake in BHR to finally lay to rest questions about his business dealings. That impression was only bolstered in late 2019, when then-candidate Joe Biden pledged that, if elected, his family would relinquish any foreign business ventures. ‚ÄúNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,‚Äù Joe Biden told voters. Despite the rhetoric, however, Hunter Biden appears to have kept his ten percent stake in BHR, according to a report by the Daily Caller. That determination was made after the outlet reviewed corporation records filed with China‚Äôs National Credit Information Publicity System through two firms specializing in market research and intelligence. Such revelations come as questions remain about how much Biden‚Äôs equity in BHR is actually worth. Biden, who claims to have never received any compensation from his service on BHR‚Äôs board, has asserted, through a family lawyer, that his stake in the firm is only worth $420,000. Ethics watchdogs, however, contend that valuation is potentially off by millions. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a ten percent stake in those economics is worth only $420K,‚Äù Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago‚Äôs Booth School of Business, told FactCheck.org in October 2019. ‚ÄúThe distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 [million] even if the fund manages $2 [billion],‚Äù Kaplan added at the time. ‚ÄúThe value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 [million] if they are managing $2 [billion].‚Äù As Breitbart News has reported, Biden‚Äôs ties to the firm have long been at the center of ethical controversy. In December 2013, the younger Biden flew aboard Air Force Two with his father to Beijing. The trip was part of an official state visit the then-vice president was making to the country amid escalating tensions with the United States over islands in the South China Sea. Although it is unclear exactly what transpired during the journey, Biden entered into a lucrative business arrangement shortly afterward. Only 12 days after the trip, Biden and his business partners inked a multibillion-dollar deal with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China.

At the end of July 2015, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) selected Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Games. Since then‚Äîand despite claims by the IOC and Beijing Olympic Committee that the Games will serve as a catalyst for progress‚ÄîPresident Xi Jinping has unleashed an unrelenting crackdown on basic freedom and human rights. The situation in occupied Tibet has dramatically deteriorated and has been transformed into a surveillance state with over 1,000 political prisoners facing torture and even death; in East Turkistan (Ch: Xinjiang) between 1.8 and three million Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples are arbitrarily detained in ‚Äúre-education camps,‚Äù enduring inhuman treatment and political indoctrination; in Hong Kong, the city‚Äôs vibrant community of human rights activists and outspoken youths have been rounded up by the thousands for simply advocating for democracy; in Southern Mongolia, children are being deprived of their right to speak their mother tongue, as the Chinese government has intensified its crackdown on cultural differences. China‚Äôs reach extends to extreme intimidation and geopolitical bullying of Taiwan and aggression and expansion across borders in the South China Sea and India-Tibet border, which present a clear threat to regional and global security. For two decades, our coalition, members of frontline communities, and numerous human rights groups have repeatedly sought to inform the IOC about these conditions, explain the dangers of awarding China the Olympic Games, and caution against accepting any human rights assurances from one of the world‚Äôs worst human rights violators. The IOC refused to listen in 2008, defending its decision with claims that they would prove to be a catalyst for improved human rights. As human rights experts predicted, this decision proved to be hugely misplaced; not only did China‚Äôs human rights record not improve but violations increased substantially without rebuke. Now, in 2021, we find ourselves back in the same position with the IOC who are refusing to act despite the clear evidence of genocide and widespread and worsening human rights failures. It now falls on governments to take a stand and demonstrate that they have the political will to push back against China‚Äôs reprehensible human rights abuses.

2021-02-07 0:47:35,"MY TURN GUYANA DIRT IN THE DEAL By Moses Nagamootoo The buzz in diplomatic circles that a deal had been made with the out-going Trump cabal for Guyana to roll back relations with the People‚Äôs Republic of China by embracing Taiwan, soon became a dirty scandal. Exposed, the PPP regime has since unilaterally revoked what was apparently intended as a secret ‚Äúagreement‚Äù for the establishment of a Taiwanese Consulate in Georgetown. I commend the New York-based Rickford Burke and Guyana‚Äôs Opposition Leader Joseph Harmon for exposing the dirt in this deal, and the damage it has inflicted on our foreign policy. The agreement was not a mistake, as the government claimed. There is still mud on the carpet, which will not go away unless and until the regime comes clean on the issue. GUYANA-CHINA BONDS Guyana had firmly established close relations with Beijing since 1972, when the People‚Äôs Republic of China assumed its rightful place at the United Nations as the sole, legitimate representative of the Chinese people. For Guyana, there is one China only. Guyana-China bonds were cemented by history and blood when in 1856, Chinese first arrived in this South American, British settler-colony as sugar plantation labourers. Our Chinese-Guyanese compatriots have since formed part of the rich and diverse tapestry of ethnic communities in Guyana. China exuded positive influence on Guyana‚Äôs struggle for independence. Our first President was of Chinese origin. Our two major political parties, over time, forged party-to-party, fraternal ties with the Communist Party of China (CPC). A close and dependable friend of the Guyanese people, China is not known to have interfered in Guyana‚Äôs internal affairs. Its generous, all-round assistance in almost every field of Guyanese life stands out as a monument of cooperation between two developing countries. POST-ELECTION CHANGE But all of that started to unravel after the 2020 elections, as soon as the PPP cabal was pitch-forked into office with the not-so-covert help by and threats of sanctions from the Trump administration. During a lightning shuttle to Georgetown in September, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo levelled a blistering attack on China, and likened their investors to ‚Äúpredators‚Äù. Soon enough local ministerial hirelings started to publicly bark threats at Chinese contractors for what they claimed to be tardy works at on-going government projects. By January 12, the regime gave a cold shoulder to the observance of Chinese Arrival Day, which has been an annual event. By then, on January 10, Pompeo had announced that the Trump administration has lifted restrictions on US-Taiwan relations. Those relations had been frozen since 1972 after the ‚Äúping pong‚Äù diplomacy of President Nixon and, later, under President Carter became known as the One China policy to which the United States is still committed. Guyana has also embraced that policy, and had ceased business with Taiwan, which is neither a sovereign nor independent entity. But with the Pompeo declaration on Taiwan, the door was opened for Guyana to flip-flop on its long-standing ‚ÄúOne China‚Äù policy. Students of China diplomacy would know that the principle of the indivisibility of China has become the cornerstone of Chinese relations with all countries. It‚Äôs One China, sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúOne China, two Systems‚Äù principle, is not reversible. Anyone crossing that ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù should not expect to benefit from the friendship and generosity of a powerful state whose investors currently have a lien on one-quarter of Guyana‚Äôs oil/gas resources. Why then would Guyana collude with Taiwan to make an agreement allegedly on January 11 (the day after Pompeo lifted restrictions against Taiwan), to open a Taiwanese Consular Office in Georgetown? These questions need urgent answers: 1. Who authorized that decision? 2. Who signed that Agreement? 3. Where was the Agreement signed? 4. Why were the Guyanese people kept in the dark on a matter of such grave national importance? BACK-ROOM DEAL I hope in the interest of transparency that this so-called Agreement will be laid in the National Assembly. There is no doubt that this development has cast a blemish on Guyana-China relations, and could have ruptured them as a result of the irresponsible, reckless and opportunistic ploy of the PPP regime. There is much work left for the Guyanese people to unmask the ‚ÄúDons‚Äù behind this deal. For me, signing the agreement was a give-away; revoking it was a cover-up.

Nigeria is very satisfied with the progress of bilateral relations, and we thank China for its support to us in various ways; in building of rail, road, power, defence, and many other areas. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China has been working with Nigeria and other African countries to safeguard the lives and health of our citizens, adding new dimensions to our friendship. We acknowledge that Chinese support tremendously strengthened our effort against the pandemic. In recent years, Nigeria and China have also witnessed steady development of their strategic partnership. In the face of significant challenges faced by international community, the two sides are upholding a common position of preserving multilateralism, not interfering in other countries‚Äô internal affairs and safeguarding common interest of developing countries.

2021-02-19 11:22:23,"Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) fired a verbal volley at the Chinese Communist regime in a speech at the Reagan Institute on Thursday as he unveiled his latest report on U.S. strategy toward China: ‚ÄúBeat China: Targeted Decoupling and the Economic Long War.‚Äù Cotton said in his opening remarks: This evil empire preys on and spies on Americans. It imprisons innocent people in concentration camps, it uses slave labor to fuel its factories and it denies the most basic freedoms to all of its 1.4 billion people. We need to beat this evil empire and consign the Chinese Communists ‚Äî just like the Bolsheviks ‚Äî to the ash heap of history. Cotton criticized U.S. policy towards China over the last several decades where politicians engaged China as a strategic partner while American corporations worked to integrate their economies, hurting American workers. ‚ÄúMany believed that open markets and open borders would make China rich, and then make China free. So for decades they fed the tiger and made it more powerful,‚Äù he said. He added: A tidal wave of Chinese imports flooded our markets, sweeping away millions of high-paying American manufacturing jobs, and devastating the communities that depended on those factories. This did indeed make China rich. But instead of reforming and becoming free, the Communist Party began to exploit the new connections between our free society and its totalitarian society. As American schools began accepting hundreds of thousands of Chinese nationals each year to work and study, the Chinese government turned some of them into spies, he said. When U.S. companies tried to access China‚Äôs huge consumer market, Beijing forced them to hand over proprietary technology and pledge never to speak out against the Party in any way, or speak up for its victims, he added. And finally, after America outsourced production of even essential goods to China, the Chinese Communist Party began threatening to cut it off, he said. He said this week, the Chinese government proposed export controls on rare-earth elements essential to the F-35, the U.S. military‚Äôs most advanced weapons system. ‚ÄúChina has a virtual monopoly on rare-earth mining and processing. That means Beijing could ground our jets at almost any time, just by cutting off access to a few key inputs. It‚Äôs sad that a great nation would ever find itself in such a position,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Chinese Communist Party is no paper tiger, and we cannot afford to wait passively for its collapse or reform,‚Äù he said. However, he noted growing American will to confront China and said it would be difficult today for President Joe Biden to toast CCP Chairman Xi Jinping at the White House as he did less than 10 years ago. ‚ÄúToday such an event would be a grave scandal,‚Äù he said. He called for a number of reforms and steps the U.S. should take to ensure it is not defeated by China. He said the U.S. government should expand the Trump administration‚Äôs financial sanctions against the CCP‚Äôs worst actors to include Chinese companies that steal American intellectual property (IP), or that benefit from stolen IP. ‚ÄúThe message should be clear: steal from Americans once, look over your shoulder forever,‚Äù he said. He also called for terminating China‚Äôs Permanent Normal Trade Relations status and returning to the old system where the U.S. president and Congress would review China‚Äôs trade privileges each year, in light of its progress on human rights. He said the U.S. should tighten export controls to prevent China from obtaining cutting-edge technology with military applications, such as semiconductors, 5G telecommunications equipment, Artificial Intelligence, and quantum computers, he said. Cotton also said the U.S. should boost investment in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing so the future of those critical technologies is made in America, not China. And he said the U.S. should also bring back production of critical goods, such as essential medicines, medical supplies, and rare-earth elements. He said the U.S. should seek to cut off the ‚Äúspigot‚Äù of money from China to American elites. ‚ÄúWe need to cut off the spigot of money that has fueled China‚Äôs rise and corrupted our elites, creating a China Lobby stretching from New York and Washington to Silicon Valley and Hollywood, touching corporate boardrooms and college campuses in between,‚Äù he said. He also called for a number of measures to strengthen U.S. scrutiny of Chinese investments and Chinese students coming to study in the U.S. in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).

2021-02-20 19:00:47,"Today is World Pangolin Day! Have you ever heard of a pangolin? As the world‚Äôs most trafficked wild mammal, these unique animals are in serious danger. Of the eight species of pangolin, three are classified as critically endangered, three are endangered and the remaining two are considered threatened. All pangolins are covered in sharp, over-lapping scales that serve as armor from predators. When threatened, they will curl into a tight ball, using their armored tail to protect their head. Their scales are made of keratin, just like our hair and nails, and grow throughout the animal‚Äôs lifetime. While being the only scaled mammal is impressive, their appearance only scratches the surface of how truly unique pangolins are. Their diet consists mainly of insects, and as they rely heavily on ants for their main food source, their muscular forelimbs have sharp, curved claws for digging into ant mounds. Their slender jaw does not house any teeth, but instead a long sticky tongue that they use to probe for and catch their prey. That sticky tongue is anchored near the animal‚Äôs pelvis and can be as long as half the animal‚Äôs body! Because they do not have teeth, a pangolin‚Äôs stomach is very muscular and has keratinous protrusions on the inside to help break food down, much like a bird‚Äôs gizzard. Although pangolins are similar to anteaters, they are actually closer relations to the family Carnivora, which includes cats, dogs and bears. Pangolins can be found in a range of habitats, including woodland forests, brushland, cultivated land, and grasslands. Some species are strictly terrestrial, while others are skilled climbers and take to the trees for foraging. Four species are native to Africa; the Ground Pangolin, Black-bellied Pangolin, Giant Pangolin, and White-bellied Pangolin. (Giant Pangolins can be up to 73lbs and are the largest of the species.) The other four species are all native to Asia; the Indian Pangolin, Chinese Pangolin, Sunda Pangolin, and Palawan Pangolin.

They recently completed and handed over to us a primary school in Mmopane.

The Chinese government has also been involved in education and training, infrastructural, agricultural and tourism projects in Botswana. China has recently opened up its market to Botswana beef and the deal is expected to kickstart in mid-2021. I also sent my message of goodwill and gratitude to President Xi Jingping and his Government for having gifted Botswana with personal protective equipment used in the fight against COVID 19 last year as well as assisting with other preventative strategies against COVID 19. China recently extended a P102 million loan forgiveness and has in the past assisted with other interest-free and concessionary loans. All these are a result of the strong bilateral relations we have.

An in-depth study of Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúweakness‚Äù on China from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) contains background information on Burns‚Äô affiliations with prominent CCP members. According to the report, while Burns was president of the board of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he welcomed Zhang Yichen to the board. Zhang is a Chinese businessman linked to two major CCP organizations, the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultive Conference and the Center for China Globalization. Zhang‚Äôs firm, along with the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation, an organization connected to the CCP and responsible for ‚ÄúUnited Front‚Äù work in the U.S., gave Carnegie millions of dollars to help build the think tank‚Äôs Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua center. If confirmed by the Senate, Burns would be the first CIA leader whose experience is largely from the State Department, where he served under both Republican and Democrat presidents. He rose through the diplomatic corps ranks to become deputy secretary of state before retiring in 2014 to run the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace. While at the State Department, Burns helped negotiate former President Barack Obama‚Äôs 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which failed to stop the regime‚Äôs desire to weaponize its program. Instead, the deal paved the way for them to do so legally in the future. Former President Donald Trump canceled the deal. After Trump took office in 2017, Burns held his tongue until 2020, when he began writing highly critical pieces of the Trump administration‚Äôs policies in Foreign Affairs and other publications. Burns has been a staunch advocate of ‚Äúrebuilding and restructuring the foreign service,‚Äù positions he shares with Biden. ‚ÄúAmbassador Burns will bring the knowledge, judgment and perspective we need to prevent and confront threats before they can reach our shores,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúThe American people will sleep soundly with him as our next CIA director.‚Äù",0.089577995,0.0041317632,0.03193111,0.06857169,0.013115914,0.014026939

2021-03-04 14:48:34,"Foreign nationals gathered at the United States-Mexico border this week to demand President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration release them into the interior of the country, as they have done with thousands of other border crossers. On March 2, about a hundred foreign nationals from Mexico, Central America, Haiti, and Cuba protested near San Ysidro, California in Tijuana, Mexico where they requested the Biden administration allow them into the U.S. Wearing t-shirts with Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign logo and the words ‚ÄúPlease let us in!‚Äù the group of foreign nationals held signs that read ‚ÄúBiden ‚Äî please let me enter.‚Äù In interviews with AFP, some of the foreign nationals said Biden ought to allow them to enter the U.S. while they await their asylum claims as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has done with others. ‚ÄúWe want an answer from your president, we want someone to come out and give us an answer,‚Äù one of the protesters told nearby U.S. federal immigration officials. As Breitbart News has reported, the Biden administration has been releasing thousands of border crossers into the U.S. every week. In the case of 25,600 migrants who were enrolled in the Remain in Mexico program, which Biden ended, the United Nations is facilitating releases of migrants into the country. Most recently, reports confirmed that border crossers released into American communities are testing positive for the Chinese coronavirus and still do not have to adhere to quarantine requirements. Instead, after testing positive, border crossers can continue traveling into the U.S. interior. The massive restart of the Catch and Release program, as a result of Biden ending the Remain in Mexico program and cooperative asylum agreements with Central America, is driving a flood of illegal immigration to the southern border. This year, DHS officials are expecting to welcome at least 117,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) into the U.S. Biden‚Äôs restart of Catch and Release has garnered significant opposition from most Americans. When asked if border crossers should be returned to Mexico or released into the U.S. interior, 67 percent of Americans told Harvard/Harris pollsters that they should be returned to Mexico ‚Äî including 54 percent of Hispanic Americans and 68 percent of swing voters. üì∑: AP/Getty/AFP",0.10031791,0.004845161,0.049791817,0.082755424,0.028185261,0.016688054

OECS Heads of Government, including PM Gaston Browne, met this morning in the Sixth Special Meeting of the OECS Authority devoted entirely to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had a fulsome interaction with special invitee the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus. OECS chairman PM Roosevelt Skerrit commended Dr. Tedros on his exemplary leadership of the WHO during a period of international crisis, and he focused the discussion on the most urgent challenges facing OECS member states at this time. The WHO Director-General acknowledged that the OECS region had seen some success in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, but emphasized that the critical issue now was collaboration among countries to manage the risks associated with international travel. Dr. Tedros explained that he had called on vaccine-producing countries to adopt ‚Äòvaccine equity‚Äô, not as charity but as a means to allow all countries to overcome the pandemic. The meeting heard that only one country in the region had received any vaccines from the COVAX facility: Jamaica. Heads discussed the urgency of having vaccine production and distribution ramped up as quickly as possible. Dr. Tedros agreed to pay full attention to small states‚Äô issues and to make the supply of vaccines a top priority for the WHO. He revealed that 76% of global vaccine production had so far gone to only a few rich countries. Several Heads of Government pointed out that the bottlenecks in international vaccine supply had the effect of prolonging the recovery process in their COVID-hit countries; and that the promise of 600 million COVAX doses by June 2021 seemed unrealistic. It was pointed out that even if all the vaccine doses under COVAX were delivered, there would still be a ‚Äòvaccine gap‚Äô that would have to be filled. Statistics available to the meeting revealed that Antigua and Barbuda had so far inoculated the second-highest percentage of its population in the CARICOM region, at 25%. Only Anguilla had inoculated a higher percentage (31%). PM Browne urged that vaccine accessibility should be based, not on purchasing power or strictly commercial considerations, but rather on vulnerability. He also questioned why the WHO seemed to be taking so long to give approval to the Russian and Chinese vaccines, Sputnik V and Sinopharm, pointing out that the delayed approval was also related to the issue of ‚Äòvaccine hesitancy‚Äô among OECS populations. For his part, Dr. Tedros undertook to raise the issue of accessibility and vulnerability on 23rd March when there will be a summit of the world‚Äôs major vaccine producers; and to contact President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa regarding the possible availability of excess vaccines for OECS member states, as well as President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya in his capacity as chair of the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries. ‚ÄòThe race to herd immunity is on‚Äô said PM Browne, ‚Äòand we look to Dr. Tedros and the WHO to assist in urgently increasing our accessibility to vaccines on reasonable terms and therefore widening our vaccine options.‚Äô",0.062125895,0.003314328,0.021555077,0.025660424,0.009976466,0.013084461

2021-04-03 23:19:47,"MY TURN GUYANA By Moses V. Nagamootoo RESURRECTION OF RESISTANCE As we celebrate Easter, we must remind ourselves that Christ‚Äôs holy mission is not complete. While the poor remain ‚Äòblessed‚Äô, they are yet to inherit the Earth. Far from it: they are the 99% of Earth‚Äôs estimated 7.7 billion people who own only one percent of the wealth of the world. The filthy rich have gobbled up almost everything. Surely goodness and mercy have eluded the poor, the so-called ‚Äúwretched of the earth‚Äù, who are today most vulnerable to the deadliest virus of all times. SYSTEMIC RACISM They are the ones who endure poverty, hunger and disease. They are the victims of wars waged by foreigners and their proxies. They are made destitute by their home-grown tyrants and corrupt cabals. They are exploitation by Big Business; and suffer systemic racism and injustices. So, Easter must represent the resurrection of resistance to the evils that engulf us. Growing up in a rural village, I saw squalor around me. Many children roam the village in rags, without shoes, uncertain about the future. My parents were not exactly poor, so I also saw how they reached out to those who could not make ends meet. As a boy I would sometimes look at the clouds. I would imagine on them the image of a gentle God who could change the life of my villagers for the better. VICIOUS CYCLE At about eleven years, I voluntarily baptized at the Lutheran Church, as I searched for salvation for the many who were trapped in the vicious cycle of want and hopelessness. But I realized soon enough how several foreign preachers mis-used the scriptures for political purposes. Instead of helping the poor to free themselves from their colonial shackles, they preached anti-communism; vilified righteous leaders; and peddled from way back then, outrageous lies packaged as ‚Äúplain truth‚Äù. Six decades later we continued to see how the lofty mission I had imagined has been hijacked by so-called extremists to bludgeon civilized and democratic norms, to spread racist fears and terror, and to unleash hate and discrimination. The targeting of Blacks is not a peculiar American phenomenon. Since the advent of capitalism, they have been hunted commercially for their black skin, as Karl Marx had observed. In the United States, we have seen the targeting of Black Americans, most of whom are themselves Christians. Now, we are witnessing gruesome attacks against Asian Americans, mostly those of Chinese origins. In the late 1960s, while on a bus in London, I was attacked by a gang of ‚ÄúSkinheads‚Äù ‚Äì white youths with shaved heads. They were in shabby clothes, but they wore racism in their heart. They were on a frenzy of ‚ÄúPaki-bashing‚Äù and, as a Guyanese of Asian background, they must have concluded that I was a Paki. Lucky for me, a group of Jamaicans came to my rescue. I am aware that there are many Indo-Guyanese in the United States who wrongly feel that the ‚Äòpogrom‚Äô of anti-Asian hate excludes them. It‚Äôs the Blacks; it‚Äôs the Latinos; it‚Äôs the Chinese. But, as Pastor Martin Niemoller advised during Nazi reign: ‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.‚Äù TIME FOR SOLIDARITY Today we must stand up to the wrongs being done around us. We must resist anti-Chinese xenophobia. We can no longer remain silent. This is the time for solidarity with all victims of hate and violence. I remember only too well the American war of aggression against Vietnam. It was wrongly felt that the mighty empire would crush those ‚Äútiny yellow people‚Äù, as Muhamad Ali once described the heroic Vietnamese people. America learned a humiliating lesson not only because the Vietnamese people stood up against bullyism, but because the world stood in solidarity with them and their just cause. The American thinker Herbert Aptheker reminded us that resistance is the core of history. We must not lose hope. We too must resist the abuse of race and religion by evil-doers everywhere.

The Washington Post/ABC News poll revealed that about 53 percent of American adults said they disapprove of the way Biden is handling illegal immigration at the southern border ‚Äî including 42 percent who said they ‚Äústrongly disapprove‚Äù of Biden‚Äôs handling and 10 percent who said they ‚Äúsomewhat disapprove.‚Äù Just 37 percent of American adults said they approved of Biden‚Äôs handling of illegal immigration. The poll showed that Biden‚Äôs transformation of the U.S.-Mexico border into a welcoming center for border crossers to merely check-in at before their release into the nation‚Äôs interior is unpopular with swing voters, GOP voters, those who lean Republican, conservatives, and non-college-educated Americans. About 58 percent of swing voters said they disapprove of Biden‚Äôs handling of illegal immigration, along with 86 percent of Republicans, 85 percent of those who lean Republican, and 78 percent of conservatives. Meanwhile, 56 percent of non-college-educated Americans said they disapproved of Biden‚Äôs handling of illegal immigration ‚Äî including 72 percent of white non-college-educated Americans. Across income levels, a plurality of 48 percent earning less than $50,000 a year disapprove of Biden‚Äôs handling of illegal immigration, as well as 52 percent of those earning $50,000 to $100,000 a year, and 62 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year. The poll is the latest to show that the issue of mass immigration to the U.S. is dragging down Biden‚Äôs approval. Voters in swing districts, for example, are moving toward Republicans strictly because of Biden‚Äôs handling of illegal immigration, polls found this month. Aside from the skyrocketing illegal immigration levels at the southern border, where nearly 170,000 border crossers were apprehended in March, the Biden administration has gutted interior immigration enforcement. Last week, for instance, Biden‚Äôs Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced they would no longer be fining illegal aliens who refused to depart the U.S. after having previously committing to do so. Instead, Biden is canceling the debt of illegal aliens who were fined under former President Trump‚Äôs administration. Likewise, DHS is preventing about 9-in-10 deportations with ‚Äúsanctuary country‚Äù orders that have resulted in a 70 percent drop in the number of criminal illegal aliens in federal custody and an 80 percent reduction in arrests of illegal aliens.",0.118584804,0.004874886,0.07365516,0.095739305,0.015348409,0.012844222

2021-05-01 23:10:26,"MY TURN GUYANA By Moses V. Nagamootoo* MAY DAY! MAY DAY!! The cock over the back-trench crowed at sunrise. The birds on trees in our yard chirped joyously as they helped themselves to mangoes, cherries, sapodillas and even peppers. Nothing today appeared unusual. Except there were no marches, no parades in red, no unfurled banners, no songs puncturing the air: ‚Äúsolidarity forever! soliidaaarity for evvveeer!‚Äù Today is May Day in Guyana and around the world. It is a day when working peoples celebrate their gains in struggles; and highlight their demands for a better deal. HARDEST HIT But the working poor have been hit hardest. Already made hand-to-mouth by capitalist profit-grabbers and their cronies in government, they are also devastated by the Covid pandemic. Many have no jobs, no rent money. They survive on handouts. It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúMay Day‚Äù, as we knew it. Working peoples are appealing for their lives. They literally gasp for breath. They are sending out a collective SOS, like a distressed ship or crippled plane before it goes down, desperately screaming ‚ÄúMay Day! May Day!!‚Äù India and Brazil are not the only countries that are paralysed, but they dramatise the plight of the poor and jobless as being the most exposed and vulnerable to the ravages of the pandemic. In Guyana, we are nowhere close to being worse off than our neighbours, but our figures have triggered an alarm bell. Covid cases have reached the 13,000 number; deaths have climbed to 300. Government has bluntly refused to reimpose a 6 pm to 6 am curfew, and has irresponsibly left openings until 10:30 pm each day for a free-for-all spread. The Head of State stubbornly rejects the idea of meeting with the Opposition Leader, not even for a photo op, to send a united message to the Guyanese people to take the covid vaccine. SHROUD OF SADNESS In the wake of this shroud of sadness and political madness, officials ordered a shut-down on May Day public marches. While that was the sensible thing to so, disgruntled workers and their unions could also read into that decision an interest by Government to protect itself. May Day would give anti-government detractors space to show-case the arbitrary, politically-driven and vindictive sacking of large numbers of state and para-state employees after it was installed in August, 2020. That space could be shared by youths aspiring to become professionals, who have been sent home when the public service college and the Youth Corps were unceremoniously shut down. Of course, today public servants would have demonstrated in full force their demands for what they have called ‚Äúa living wage‚Äù. BREAD AND SAFETY It was easy to put that protest on hold. But what cannot be shelved are the concerns of working people for racial equality, gender justice, social inclusion and public and health safety. But, even late in the day, it still is an occasion for solidarity with the Guyanese working people. Thank you to our all of our medical providers ‚Äì Guyanese, Cubans and Chinese included; as well as emergency workers in sanitary and other essential services. We must let our public servants, our men and women in uniform know that we appreciate what they do for us; that they are on their job for us all at great risk. May Day has been for me a special occasion. I have always considered myself as a labour man. The labour movement has been my political incubator. The red flag, for me, remains the symbol of struggle and the banner of our Guyana people‚Äôs revolution. FREE AT LAST In spite of the apparent pro-government and anti-government apartheid that had divided our union leaders and the labour movement, Guyana has proudly remained a pro-labour Republic. The genesis of our political struggles for self-emancipation is rooted in the longing by the bare-footed workers in the colonial plantations for bread with justice. With ‚Äúmassa day done‚Äù their expectations over the decades have grown. Our workers now want the good life; and no one, in this oil era, would hold them back or put them down for wanting to one day soon sing, in the famous words of Martin Luther King: ‚Äúfree at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!‚Äù May 1, 2021 *The author, a journalist and attorney, is the former Prime Minister of Guyana.",0.12309273,0.008204076,0.034353938,0.09291975,0.107291095,0.01975573

Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""What excitement, Jabarin is the 1,000,000th person in the State of Israel to be vaccinated. We are breaking all of the records. We brought millions of vaccines to the State of Israel. We are ahead of the entire world and now we are ahead of them with our excellent HMOs. We are moving forward at great speed in order to vaccinate the entire population. It is important to me also that the Arab population in the State of Israel be vaccinated quickly. It is important because this saves lives and only thus will we be able to return to normal lives. As soon as we reach a critical mass of people who are vaccinated, we will be able to open commerce, the stores and the restaurants. We will be able to fly abroad, to make deals and travel in all the countries that we have made peace with, peace that has opened the world and is also changing our history, as Israeli society and as a country. There is responsibility and there is a lack of responsibility. The responsibility is to bring the vaccines and distribute them. The lack of responsibility is ‚Äì at the same time ‚Äì to allow the disease to run amok. I regret that this has not happened; therefore, I would like to take this opportunity here and say that we will continue to bring vaccines and I call on the public to be vaccinated."" Health Minister Edelstein: ""Now, after the 1,000,000th person to be vaccinated is here with us, it is possible to say with certainty that Israel, with G-d's help, will be the first country in the world to be vaccinated. This is a great achievement. Within a few months, we will be able to say: 'Hasta la vista' to the coronavirus and return to normality. We are all in this together. There is no difference between Jews and Arabs, religious and secular. As long as we are unsuccessful in reaching great numbers of vaccinated people in every place, we will be unable to go out to all of the places that are so important to us all.

Contrary to what is being said, we are ahead of the whole world. No country has done what we are about to do. We are doing this. We are hermetically closing the skies apart from very rare exceptions in order to prevent the entry of mutated viruses and in order to ensure that we will advance quickly with our vaccines operation, 'Back to Life', so that we will vaccinate more Israelis within a short time. I would like to emphasize that just this week, in which we are approving closing the skies, we will vaccinate another approximately one million Israelis. We are thereby ensuring that the damage from the mutation, if it enters, and from additional variants, if they enter, will be much smaller, and of course, we will be able to open our economy. Until now we have vaccinated approximately 2.5 million Israeli citizens with the first dose of the vaccine. Of these, around one million citizens have received the second dose. I would like to appeal to people over 60 who have yet to be vaccinated; this is about 20% of you. 80% is a very fine result but it is not enough because 20% of you are susceptible to being hurt. I urge you ‚Äì go and be vaccinated. Our goal is to increase the pace of vaccinations within a few days, perhaps tomorrow or the day after, to 250,000 vaccinations per day. This is a vast number. In the US, up until today, approximately four million people have been vaccinated with two doses. We have 1/40 the population and have already vaccinated one million people with two doses. That means we are vaccinating at 10 times the pace as the US. In this way, we are guarding the outer envelope and massively vaccinating from within. Later this week we will hold a discussion on the strategy for exiting the lockdown. I assure you that we will do this cautiously and responsibly. I would like to say something about following the directives. I expect all citizens of Israel to follow the directives, and this includes all sectors, including the ultra-orthodox sector. I must point out that the majority in the ultra-orthodox sector are following the directives, but there are exceptions and exceptions whose actions are unacceptable. Therefore, whoever does not follow the directives, we will act and we will enforce the law. We will also enforce the directives, of course, as needs to be done, everywhere. I would also like to say that I am advancing legislation, which we will submit to the Knesset tomorrow, regarding the fines. This is what must be done. We are submitting it for a first reading because this is what the law says must be done when the Knesset is in recess but the intention is to pass it on its second and third readings without delay. This is also my directive; I hope that you will also cooperate. Today we are also submitting the historic agreement on the establishment of relations between Israel and Morocco. Indeed this is a historic moment, after four peace agreements with four Islamic and Arab countries in four months. I would like to commend King Mohammed VI of Morocco on the cooperation between us. Together we are advancing direct flights between the countries, which will happen soon, as well as economic, commercial and technological cooperation and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì the opening of missions in the two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to again congratulate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their entry into office. I look forward to working with President Biden to further strengthen the strong alliance between the US and Israel, expand the circle of peace between Israel and the Arab world on behalf of a new Middle East and ‚Äì of course ‚Äì to also deal with our common challenges, especially the Iranian threat."" The Prime Minister added: ""This week we will mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The victims of the Holocaust, six million of our people; this is a number that we have already surpassed in the State of Israel. Nevertheless, there are those who aspire to destroy the State of Israel and say so openly, on a daily basis, and this is the regime of the ayatollahs in Iran. They speak not about the annihilation of another six million, we are already approaching seven million Jews, they intend to try and destroy us ‚Äì inter alia ‚Äì by developing nuclear weapons. They are furthering the new antisemitism with a wave that opposes what we are doing with some of the Arab countries, who have already changed their attitude to the Jewish people, to Jews in general, and also to the State of Israel. They are stoking venomous antisemitism any way they can in order to destroy us and kill additional millions. Of course, their strange allies, that they have in Europe, who are sometimes anti-Muslim as well, are also in on this. They share this anti-Jewish, antisemitic line. Therefore, we are also fighting antisemitism. When (truncated)",0.09709594,0.0034332275,0.015603342,0.023607591,0.006383543,0.011384304

2021-01-27 6:01:08,"Today, January 27th, the world officially commemorates the six million Jewish men, women and children brutally murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators in the Holocaust. We remember this darkest chapter in human history, when a European country decided to adopt a policy and a program to exterminate every last Jew, mobilizing the full power of a modern developed industrial state to implement this incredible nightmare. The mass murder of the Jewish people did not happen in a vacuum. For centuries antisemitism had been all too prevalent across Europe. Unchallenged, it grew and festered and then exploded. This oldest of hatreds had unquestionable longevity. Its roots stretch back to the ancient world. It was ever-present throughout the middle ages. And yet, it exploded with full force in the modern era. And if people thought that following the horrors of Auschwitz and Treblinka, humanity would finally learn its lesson and rid itself of antisemitism, that it would throw it into the dustbin of history where it belongs, well, they were wrong. Dead wrong. In the twenty-first century, the disease of antisemitism continues to contaminate and spread. It can be found alive, kicking and pernicious on North American university campuses, in South Asian madrassas, among European elites. Antisemitism exists in the affluent West and in the developing world in the East. It is the official policy of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which unabashedly and proudly says day in and day out: our goal is to murder another six million Jews, to eradicate the Jewish State of Israel. A vaccine to safeguard against the antisemitism virus has yet to be found. It is said that some things never change. But I can tell you what has changed. We the Jewish people have changed. If at the time of the Holocaust, the Jews were homeless, stateless, defenseless, begging others to protect us ‚Äì no longer. Today we are firmly rooted in our ancient land, free and strong in our independent state. As prime minister of the country that was reborn after the Holocaust, the country that provided a homeland for the survivors, a state that rose from the ashes, a state in which the Jewish people regained their sovereignty and independence, I vow never to forget the tragic past and never to allow the Jewish people to once again be defenseless against the forces that seek our destruction. Never again isn‚Äôt a slogan. This is our policy and this is our mission and we will always carry it out.

Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""My first message in Ar'ara is that I am happy and proud to be here. It took 40 hours since our meeting in my office for me to come here. I have come here in order to save lives. We are fighting to save lives. We have brought vaccines for every citizen of the State of Israel, everyone without exception, Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Bedouin, Circassians, Druze, Christians ‚Äì everyone without exception. We are in a situation in which we can exit from this accursed disease and gradually open our economy. We must make a common effort to exit from the coronavirus thanks to the millions of vaccines that we have. We can open our economy if we take care to fight the mutation. The mutation is currently striking the whole world; we are in a close race with it. We want to win and get rid of it; for this, a final effort is required. I know how difficult this is for citizens, the self-employed and businesses. I understand this. We all understand this. Nevertheless, this effort is required because only we will be able to end the pandemic. At the upcoming Cabinet meeting, I will seek to add at least two weeks to the closure of the borders and the halt to flights. We closed the land crossings because we do not want to allow the new mutations to enter at a time when we are running to be vaccinated. We can do this. In the US, it will be necessary to lock down the country for six months to a year. We need to close for a few weeks. We can end and vaccinate everybody and we are being released. This is a great thing. To this end, an effort is needed, an addition to the lockdown, which I know, is difficult, closing the borders as well. With G-d's help, and with yours, come and be vaccinated. We will be able to exit from this."" Prime Minister Netanyahu added: ""We submitted the fines law and we said that we would approve it as written. We want to vote on it now and pass the law. We need to convene and do this. Let us pass the decisions. We have no problem with the fines law as written. We have no problem in passing it today in the Knesset and we will pass it as quickly as possible.

2021-02-02 18:28:23,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Health Minister Yuli Edelstein issued statements on the issue of the coronavirus. Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""We are in the midst of a race between the 'Back to Life' vaccines operation and the mutation. This vaccines operation is our key to the coronavirus exit plan. When I say that a mutation is striking us, it is striking the entire world. In Germany they are currently talking about extending the state of emergency until June and in other countries they are extending the tightened lockdowns for many weeks. Three times as many people have died in Britain as in Israel. Every one, of course, is a loss. The mutation is also striking us. I would like to show you to what extent it is spreading. [A slide is shown.] Several days ago, it was responsible for 70% of our samples. It seems that it currently stands at 80%, a powerful and rapid spread. This is what is challenging our health system. 97% of those who have died are in the 50-and-over age group. Almost 100% of the deceased are there. Regarding serious cases, 93% of serious cases are in the 50-and-over age group. This is striking us and doing so very clearly. If we take control of the disease in these ages, if we succeed in vaccinating and protecting the people in this group, to a large extent we will be on the way to victory over the coronavirus, of course, if there are no surprises such as new mutations that we are not familiar with and which could enter Israel. This is why we closed the borders as you know. Today, I am proposing a national goal as the basis for our exit from the coronavirus: To vaccinate at least 90% of the 50+ age group within two weeks. This is an achievable goal because 77% of them are already vaccinated. We hope to complete this within the next two weeks. I call on whoever is watching us this evening, if you have not yet been vaccinated, go and be vaccinated. It is important not only for you, it is important for all of us because it is what will enable us to gradually open the economy and it is what will enable us, mainly, to save lives. I would like to tell you, every day is decisive. The significance of another three days of lockdown is another approximately 200,000 protected people. That is to say, people who received the second vaccine plus one week. Among these are 120,000 people over 50. This is simply the saving of lives. Vaccinating the 50+ age group will enable us to gradually exit from the lockdown, to save many lives and open the economy. I know that we do not intend to do this waiting for the opening. We will start the gradual opening already next week but we will exit cautiously. I will submit this national goal to the Cabinet and we will submit it together with our exit plan. I reiterate: We will exit cautiously for the exact reason you have seen here and what is happening around the world. We are one people. We will overcome this. I call on everyone: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, religious, secular, everybody: Go and be vaccinated. We are not delaying the vaccines of all the rest. This is being done according to the Health Ministry preferences. But first of all I call on everyone over 50: Go and be vaccinated immediately.""",0.11600884,0.005647734,0.033721898,0.061592385,0.018418092,0.014618298

2021-04-03 23:19:47,"MY TURN GUYANA By Moses V. Nagamootoo RESURRECTION OF RESISTANCE As we celebrate Easter, we must remind ourselves that Christ‚Äôs holy mission is not complete. While the poor remain ‚Äòblessed‚Äô, they are yet to inherit the Earth. Far from it: they are the 99% of Earth‚Äôs estimated 7.7 billion people who own only one percent of the wealth of the world. The filthy rich have gobbled up almost everything. Surely goodness and mercy have eluded the poor, the so-called ‚Äúwretched of the earth‚Äù, who are today most vulnerable to the deadliest virus of all times. SYSTEMIC RACISM They are the ones who endure poverty, hunger and disease. They are the victims of wars waged by foreigners and their proxies. They are made destitute by their home-grown tyrants and corrupt cabals. They are exploitation by Big Business; and suffer systemic racism and injustices. So, Easter must represent the resurrection of resistance to the evils that engulf us. Growing up in a rural village, I saw squalor around me. Many children roam the village in rags, without shoes, uncertain about the future. My parents were not exactly poor, so I also saw how they reached out to those who could not make ends meet. As a boy I would sometimes look at the clouds. I would imagine on them the image of a gentle God who could change the life of my villagers for the better. VICIOUS CYCLE At about eleven years, I voluntarily baptized at the Lutheran Church, as I searched for salvation for the many who were trapped in the vicious cycle of want and hopelessness. But I realized soon enough how several foreign preachers mis-used the scriptures for political purposes. Instead of helping the poor to free themselves from their colonial shackles, they preached anti-communism; vilified righteous leaders; and peddled from way back then, outrageous lies packaged as ‚Äúplain truth‚Äù. Six decades later we continued to see how the lofty mission I had imagined has been hijacked by so-called extremists to bludgeon civilized and democratic norms, to spread racist fears and terror, and to unleash hate and discrimination. The targeting of Blacks is not a peculiar American phenomenon. Since the advent of capitalism, they have been hunted commercially for their black skin, as Karl Marx had observed. In the United States, we have seen the targeting of Black Americans, most of whom are themselves Christians. Now, we are witnessing gruesome attacks against Asian Americans, mostly those of Chinese origins. In the late 1960s, while on a bus in London, I was attacked by a gang of ‚ÄúSkinheads‚Äù ‚Äì white youths with shaved heads. They were in shabby clothes, but they wore racism in their heart. They were on a frenzy of ‚ÄúPaki-bashing‚Äù and, as a Guyanese of Asian background, they must have concluded that I was a Paki. Lucky for me, a group of Jamaicans came to my rescue. I am aware that there are many Indo-Guyanese in the United States who wrongly feel that the ‚Äòpogrom‚Äô of anti-Asian hate excludes them. It‚Äôs the Blacks; it‚Äôs the Latinos; it‚Äôs the Chinese. But, as Pastor Martin Niemoller advised during Nazi reign: ‚ÄúFirst they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.‚Äù TIME FOR SOLIDARITY Today we must stand up to the wrongs being done around us. We must resist anti-Chinese xenophobia. We can no longer remain silent. This is the time for solidarity with all victims of hate and violence. I remember only too well the American war of aggression against Vietnam. It was wrongly felt that the mighty empire would crush those ‚Äútiny yellow people‚Äù, as Muhamad Ali once described the heroic Vietnamese people. America learned a humiliating lesson not only because the Vietnamese people stood up against bullyism, but because the world stood in solidarity with them and their just cause. The American thinker Herbert Aptheker reminded us that resistance is the core of history. We must not lose hope. We too must resist the abuse of race and religion by evil-doers everywhere.

2021-04-08 12:19:59,"Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks, this morning, Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day, at the ""Unto Every Person There is a Name"" ceremony at the Knesset: ""The desire to commemorate the deceased is embedded deep in human nature. This ceremony gives clear expression to this because the desire to commemorate is underscored in our people, which lost millions of our brothers and sisters in the Holocaust. We saw this desire yesterday at the torchlighting ceremony that always moves us every year. Manya Bigunov, one of the torchlighters, has dedicated her life, all of time and energy to commemorating each of the 2,000 Jews who perished from her town of Teplyk. My father-in-law Shmuel Ben-Artzi, my wife Sara's father, evaded the Holocaust because he was a pioneer. He came here in 1933. He was a Tanakh scholar; Ben-Gurion invited him to his first Tanakh study circle. He was a poet and a talented author, who won Ka-Tzenik Prize for Holocaust Literature and taught generations of students, some of whom are known to you and who said that he was an educator and teacher par excellance. While he built a life, married Chava his wife and brought four children into the world, the Holocaust never left him for a moment. We spoke with him. We said 'Come, go back to and revisit the places of your youth, Bilgoraj, and while he did not want to go back, he did want to recreate. He did so in his marvelous, moving poems, one of which I always read here. He also recreated in the book that he wrote in the last years of his life, he passed away at 97. He wrote a marvelous book entitled 'Novardok', an exemplary book about the musar yeshiva where he studied in Mezeritch. In it he describes Mezeritch which had been 80% Jewish, a college town of yeshivas, most of them Chasidic. It had yeshivas, study halls and synagogues. He dedicated his book to his old classmates, the yeshiva students who all perished. In the book, he describes 'Butchers' Street and 'Shoemakers' Street in detail. But he never went back. After his passing, his daughter, my wife Sara; his grandsons Yair and Avner, traveled together to visit the places of his youth. They went to Mezeritch. What remains are the street names, 'Butchers' and 'Shoemakers'. There reached the place where the yeshiva had been. An elderly Pole who knew who they were saw them and brought them a photograph and said 'Here is a photograph of my father who stood here'. In the photograph, they saw the yeshiva, no trace of which remains. From there they went to Tarnogrod, which had been the family's city, the family of Shmuel's grandfather who would go there every summer. Tarnogrod also had been a mainly Jewish city. Nothing remains. No trace remains of the synagogue that the SS and the Gestapo used as a stable. One can see where the holy ark was and can see bullet marks; they used to enjoy shooting at it. From Tarnogrod, they went to the grove by the river where there is a monument to the Jews of Tarnogrod who were slaughtered. Another elderly Pole came by and said 'I was a child and I would see every day how the Nazis brought Jews here and slaughtered them', including Shmuel's family of course. When they reached Bilgoraj, there was nothing because the town was totally destroyed in the war, the city of his birth, also where Isaac Bashevis Singer grew up, and Shmuel himself whom you know. A world was destroyed but exists in books, in this ceremony, in memories in the hearts of our people. Shmuel sought to commemorate it another way. In his will, he commanded that the names, which I will read to you now, be etched on his grave, which they are. Here are the names: From Bilgoraj in Poland, which was entirely destroyed in the Holocaust: His father (my wife's grandfather) Moshe Hahn (Ben Zeev Hahn), his father's wife Ita Hahn, his (my father-in-law's) twin sister Yehudit, who was 24. Shmuel did not stop weeping for her until the day before he died. His brothers Meir Dov Hahn (18), Shimon Tzvi (16) and Aryeh Leib (13), and his little sister Feizele (10). From Tarnogrod: His aunt (his father's sister) Ma'tel Koenigstein, her son Hillel and her eldest daughter. His uncle Mendel Hahn, his wife and their two children. Also from Bilgoraj: His uncle Avraham Tauber, his wife and their son and daughter. His aunt Rachel Tauber .and her three sons ‚Äì Avraham, Yaakov and Shlomo, and their wives and children. His aunt Hinda and her husband Yehezkel. His aunt Hendel, her husband and their children. His aunt Paula and her two daughters. May the memories of our brothers and sisters who perished in the Holocaust be etched in our hearts and in our souls forever.""

'You know, he‚Äôs said so many silly things,' Schloss was quoted as saying. 'I‚Äôve compared him to Hitler.

This is what‚Äôs so wrong in our society ‚Äî white supremacy. We should all treat each other as equal.' According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. hit an all-time high under Trump's presidency.

'Trump wasn‚Äôt just against the Jews ‚Äî he was against the Mexicans and many others,' Schloss said. 'Full-stop, he was a racist.'

The State of Israel has been rightly known over the years as a country that that cares for and looks after its soldiers who have served in defense of its security and who have been wounded during their service, whether in battle or during their service. Our reputation in the world was completely justified because it genuinely expressed this true relationship, which is rooted deep in the heart of the citizens of Israel. But on the other hand, one cannot deny that over the years there has been a certain slackening as happens in every bureaucratic establishment and it has become necessary to reinvigorate our commitment in both reforms and budgets. Today we are submitting for Cabinet approval the reform of the Defense Ministry Rehabilitation Division, a step that is both necessary and the right thing to do. Following many discussions and great efforts on our part, and personal intervention by myself and the Defense Minister, we have reached agreements that will get the reform underway. As we promised, this year we will transfer approximately NIS 300 million to the Rehabilitation Division, a budget that will be entered into the base of the state budget. I would like to thank the Defense and Finance ministers, the Handicapped IDF Veterans Organization and the Director General of the Prime Minister's Office for concluding the outline.

Sometimes one side was in control and excluded the other two and sometimes they traded places and the same thing happened. It could be said that in the long history of Jerusalem, only under Israeli sovereignty since 1967, have we witnessed a prolonged, stable and safe period in which we have been working to ensure freedom of worship and tolerance for all. This is not a mission that we can carry out without conflict from time to time with those same forces of intolerance that want to expropriate our rights ‚Äì first of all our rights, but not just ours ‚Äì on the Temple Mount and other holy sites. We insist on ensuring the rights of everyone, this occasionally requires taking a strong stand as the officers of the Israel Police, and our security forces, are doing at the moment.

2021-05-15 21:31:19,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: It has been five days since Hamas brazenly fired rockets at Jerusalem and other Israeli cities in a totally unprovoked attack. This past week, millions of Israelis were forced into bomb shelters as missiles rained down on our cities. Several Israelis have been killed. Many more have been wounded. You know and I know, no country would tolerate this. Israel will not tolerate this. Israel has responded forcefully to these attacks and we will continue to respond forcefully until the security of our people is reinstated and restored. We‚Äôve eliminated dozens of Hamas terrorists and taken out hundreds of terrorist sites, including missile launchers and buildings that Hamas used to plan and perpetrate these attacks. Two nights ago, Israel also seriously degraded the terror infrastructure of Hamas. We knocked out part of the vast subterranean tunnel network that Hamas uses to attack Israel. I want to remind the world that in firing on our cities, Hamas is committing a double war crime. They‚Äôre targeting our civilians and hiding behind Palestinian civilians, effectively using them as human shields. As always, Israel is doing everything possible to protect our civilians and keep Palestinian civilians out of harm‚Äôs way. We demonstrated this yet again today when we warned civilians to vacate the building used by the Hamas terror intelligence. They vacated the premises before the target was destroyed and that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt hear of casualties from these collapsing terror towers because we take special care to avoid these civilian casualties, exactly the opposite of Hamas. Defeating Hamas does not only serve Israel's interest, it serves the interests of all those who seek peace, stability and security in the Middle East. I want to thank Israel‚Äôs many friends in the international community who have strongly backed Israel‚Äôs action in defending ourselves. I want to thank the President of the United States Joe Biden and I want to thank the many countries, including European countries, who flew the Israeli flag in solidarity on their government buildings. No one should have any equivocation about the choice that is so clear here and I want to thank President Biden for his clear and unequivocal support. You cannot equate a democracy that values life with a terror organization that glorifies death. I also want to say a word about the violence we have seen in recent days within Israeli towns, from Lod to Bat Yam, from Akko to Haifa. The Jewish state will not tolerate pogroms against our citizens. We will not allow our Jewish citizens to be lynched or to live in fear of murderous Arab gangs. We will not tolerate the torching of synagogues and the torching of property. At the same time, we will not allow Jews to take the law into their own hands and attack innocent Arabs, or lynch an innocent Arab; there was one such case, such effort. We will not allow these attacks on innocent Jews or Arabs alike. To tolerate this unacceptable vigilantism and violence is to pave a way to anarchy. Israel is the Jewish and democratic state, where all our citizens, Jews, Arabs and everyone else, are equal before the law and will receive equal protection from those who enforce the law. I am fully confident that Israel will be able to deal with these threats from without and these threats from within. I am confident in our army. I am confident in our police. And above all, I am confident in the resolve and determination of the people of Israel. Just as we‚Äôve always done, we will weather this storm and emerge stronger than ever. Thank you.

We are exacting very heavy prices from Hamas for its intolerable aggression. The IDF has carried out attacks on over 1,500 targets in recent days. We have struck very hard at Hamas's underground activity. Hamas invested an entire decade and vast capital in the excavation of tunnels; most of it, not all, but a considerable part, is gone. Hamas's 'metro' has been transformed from a strategic asset into a deathtrap for terrorists. I said it yesterday and I will say it again today: No terrorist is immune. Additionally, we struck at Hamas's UAVs and drones, as well as at their naval capability. We have destroyed stockpiles of missiles and rockets. We have wrecked terrorist buildings, command centers and infrastructures throughout the Gaza Strip. We are doing this while making an effort to minimize injury to uninvolved persons. I salute the IDF, the ISA, the soldiers and fighters ‚Äì they are all doing excellent work and we are very proud of them. I request that you, Defense Minister and IDF Chief-of-Staff, convey my congratulations, our congratulations, the congratulations of the entire nation, to the soldiers of the IDF and to the fighters of the ISA as well, and to the other men and women of the security services who are doing extraordinary work. With stratagems we make war [see Proverbs 24:6] and with daring we will be victorious. We are continuing to take action, even at this hour, as long as necessary to restore quiet and security to you, citizens of Israel. It will yet take time. There is talk about international pressure. There is always pressure but all in all we are receiving very serious backing, first of all from the US. Again, I would like to thank our friend, President Joe Biden, and also the many other countries that have truly taken incredible steps such as flying the Israeli flag over their government buildings. We very much appreciate this. There is a reason for this support because after the reprehensible attacks, such as those in Jerusalem, against Israel's cities, in the attempt to kill innocent Israeli citizens ‚Äì we have international backing and we are using it, in our natural right to self-defense as well. This is what we did in Gaza and this is also what we are doing inside the country. I welcome the trend of calm that we see among the Arab public; it is not absolute. We just had a ramming attack in Jerusalem. However, all in all, we have seen a decline in this trend of violence by the Arab public and this is very important among the Arab public. I have always said that it is not the entire public and not a majority of the public but it is a significant minority, which we must deal with. We want to exact a price from the aggressor as in all types of terrorism. To restore the quiet and security and to rebuild deterrence and governance, will take time. In the face of these violent events, we have used the ISA. We deployed reinforced units throughout the country and we have carried out hundreds of arrests. We are taking action against those who used violence and disturbed the peace ‚Äì they will be punished. Our goal is, first, to halt the violence. I hope that we are achieving this. Afterwards, to rehabilitate the relations between Jews and Arabs. We live together in this state and we need to get back on the track of coexistence, cooperation and partnership in the great success called 'the State of Israel'. I would like to say an additional word, to you, citizens of Israel. What Hamas wants to achieve is, first of all, as many dead Israelis as possible. The achievement that I would like to achieve, that we would all like to achieve, is, first of all, to save your lives. Therefore, I would like to remind you that for an entire year, we changed our behavior because of the coronavirus; we changed our routine. Thanks to our behavior, thanks to the actions we took together, we saved many lives. Therefore, I ask you all ‚Äì minimize outdoor activity. Follow the directives. I am proud of your endurance. This evening we will celebrate Shavuot (https://www.jewfaq.org/holidayc.htm), the festival of the giving of the Torah. When the Torah was given, when we received the Ten Commandments, the people of Israel stood together, as Rashi (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rabbi-shlomo-yitzchaki-rashi) writes, 'As one person, with one heart.'
