 # Project Title: 
 Xenophobic Behavior on Social Media

# Project Description: 
In this project, I have shown the most similar words of the xenophobic words using word2vec, Fasttext, and GloVe models. I have also applied time series to demonstrate the mentions of xenophobic words using Chinese and Jews datasets. Additionally, I utilized n-grams (bigram, trigram) to visually depict the datasets. Finally, I compared the xenophobic terms in each dataset after combining them.
