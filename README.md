 # Project Title: 
 Xenophobic-Behavior-on-Social-Media

# Project Description: 
In this project, I have shown the top 10 most similar words to the Xenophobic words using word2vec, Fasttext, and GloVe models. I have also used time series to demonstrate the mentions of Xenophobic words in Chinese and Jews datasets. I have also used n-grams(bigram, trigram) so that the datasets can be visualized clearly.

# Word Embedding Techniques:
Word2vec, Fasttext, GloVe.

# Language: 
 Python

# IDE:
